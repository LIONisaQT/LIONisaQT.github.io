      <p>
        My name is Ryan Shee and I major in Computer Science: Computer Game Design at the University of California, Santa Cruz!
        I'll be graduating June 2018.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have experience instructing game design and development, and I've made games with Unity, Unreal Engine, PhaserJS, and libGDX.
        I've also made simple apps with Android Studio.
        I also have experience with back-end web development, thanks to Food Now!, a recent web application project.
        You can check out my game projects by clicking <a href="#game-projects" style="text-decoration: none; color: #e79100">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything on my website is currently under construction! Mobile view support will come soon!

            <a href="/shroommates" style="text-decoration: none; color: #e79100">Shroommates</a> is stealth game where users play as a sentient mushroom trying to grow in secret in a UCSC student's apartment.
            The mushroom can grow by consuming food and staying out of direct sunlight.
            Players must adapt to different sizes, as size dynamically alters speed and hiding ability.
            Complete the objectives while trying to keep out of sight of the AI human!

          <p>
             MinShmup is a simple, minimalistic shoot-em up for Android.
             The intention of the project is for me to learn in-depth about and play with various methods and functions libGDX has to offer through a simple game.
             For the player, I want to make a game that looks aethetically pleasing, satisfying to play, and easy to pick up and play whenever they hav some time to kill.
             As a developer, I want to make a light-weight game with robust, easy-to-read code, as well as use the project to exercise good game development practices.
             MinShmup currently doesn't have a public repository on GitHub, but will in the upcoming weeks.

            <li>Feels great to play, even in its prototype stage &ndash; the player receives pleasing and appropriate visual and audio feedback for various in-game actions.</li>
            <li>Fully takes advantage of libGDX's object pooling system to handle disposable objects, thus preventing any memory leaks and decreasing overall memory usage.</li>
            <li>More libGDX methods to be implemented to optimize the game even further in the future.</li>
