      <p>
        My name is Ryan Shee and I major in Computer Science: Computer Game Design at the University of California, Santa Cruz!
        I'll be graduating June 2018.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have experience instructing game design and development, and I've made games with Unity, Unreal Engine, Phaser, and libGDX.
        I've also made simple apps with Android Studio.
        On top of that, I have experience with back-end web development, thanks to Food Now!, a recent web application project.
        You can check out my game projects by clicking <a class="small-link" href="#game-projects">here</a> and view my engineering projects by clicking <a class="small-link" href="#engineering-projects">here</a>.

             The intention of the project is for me to learn in-depth about and play with various methods and functions libGDX has to offer through a simple game. I also wanted to make a simple game feel amazing to play, taking inspriration from grapefrukt games' <a class="small-link" href="http://grapefrukt.com/f/games/juicy-breakout/" target="_blank">juicy-breakout</a>.
             For the player, I want to make a game that looks aesthetically pleasing, satisfying to play, and easy to pick up to kill time with.
             As a developer, I want to make a light-weight game with robust, easy-to-read code, as well as use the project to exercise good game development practices.
             MinShmup currently doesn't have a public repository on GitHub, but will in the upcoming weeks.

            This game was three-week project for a senior game design studio class, just like Shroommates.

            Food Now! is a web application that aims to solve the problem of indecisive friends choosing a place to eat by being the final say in picking restaurants.
            The app takes in everyone's food preferences, a distance and price maximum, and then returns a random restaurant that respects the distance and price limit while best fulfilling at least one of those preferences.
            Uses React for front-end design, Express for the server framework, and Google Firebase for user login.

          Hello!
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a Computer Science: Computer Game Design student at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
          I've taken various game design and courses, ranging from programming game AI, to studying procedural content generation, to making games with a studio of talented interdisciplinary students.
          I'm proficient at object-oriented programming in Java, utilizing libGDX for mobile game development, using JavaScript for web development, and writing C# for Unity games.
          Additionally, I've dabbled in a decent amount of C++, Lua, and Python, and I'm quick to pick up languages.
          I also like to think I have a decent eye for design.
          I'm currently creeping into the proficient/experienced phase for game engines such Unreal Engine and Unity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm aiming to land a job as a game engineer/developer or game systems designer at any studio, but any software engineering job would be great as well.
          I have experience instructing a class on game design and development for Android to high school students at <a class="small-link" href="https://www.missionbit.com/" target="_blank">Mission Bit</a>, which is a great org with lots of fun people and classes.
          I will destroy almost anyone who challenges me in Smash there.
          I led my team for my Food Now! project, and am currently the lead developer of Shroommates&mdash;my senior game design studio project&mdash;so I have plenty of experience in teams, leadership, and communication.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Some online multiplayer games I'm hooked on are <a class="small-link" href="https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/home/index.aspx" target="_blank">Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</a> and
          <a class="small-link" href="https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Overwatch</a>.
          I also highly enjoy singleplayer games, most notably
          <a class="small-link" href="https://xcom.com/xcom-enemy-unknown" target="_blank">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</a> and

            My aging laptop, running KDE Neon.
            Gets about a solid 2-3 hours of work before the battery dies.
            I will eventually switch to Arch + i3wm because I've always wanted to try using Arch and because <a class="small-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn" target="_blank">Unix porn is a thing</a> (and it's glorious).
