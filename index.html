      <p>
        My name is Ryan Shee and I major in Computer Science: Computer Game Design at the University of California, Santa Cruz!
        I'll be graduating June 2018.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have experience instructing game design and development, and I've made games with Unity, Unreal Engine, PhaserJS, and libGDX.
        I've also made simple apps with Android Studio.
        I also have experience with back-end web development, thanks to Food Now!, a recent web application project.
        You can check out my game projects by clicking <a class="small-link" href="#game-projects">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything on my website is currently under construction! Mobile view support will come soon!

            <a class="small-link" href="/shroommates" target="_blank">Shroommates</a> is third-person stealth game where users play as a sentient mushroom trying to grow in secret in a UCSC student's apartment.
            The mushroom can grow by consuming food and staying out of direct sunlight.
            Players must adapt to different sizes, as size dynamically alters speed and hiding ability.
            Complete the objectives while trying to keep out of sight of the AI human!

          <p>
             MinShmup is a simple, minimalistic shoot-em up for Android.
             The intention of the project is for me to learn in-depth about and play with various methods and functions libGDX has to offer through a simple game. I also wanted to make a simple game feel amazing to play, taking inspriration from grapefrukt games' <a class="small-link" href="http://grapefrukt.com/f/games/juicy-breakout/" target="_blank">juicy-breakout</a>.
             For the player, I want to make a game that looks aethetically pleasing, satisfying to play, and easy to pick up and play whenever they have some time to kill.
             As a developer, I want to make a light-weight game with robust, easy-to-read code, as well as use the project to exercise good game development practices.
             MinShmup currently doesn't have a public repository on GitHub, but will in the upcoming weeks.

            A rhythm-based fighting game prototype.
            Play as fighters from various genres of music in a musical beatdown.
            Players are incentivized to hit on the beat to deal more damage, rather than hitting off-beat and dealing minimal damage.
            This game was three-week project for a senior game design studio class, just like Shroommates.
            At the end of the quarter, the team voted to move on with Shroommates and abandon Beat 'Em Up!

            It is a four-player game where each player takes on the role of a country's leader and become the world's superpower through use of war, famine, disease, and politicians.
