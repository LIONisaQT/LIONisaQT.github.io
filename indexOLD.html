      <p>
        My name is Ryan Shee and I major in Computer Science: Computer Game Design at the University of California, Santa Cruz!
        I'll be graduating June 2018.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have experience instructing game design and development, and I've made games with Unity, Unreal Engine, Phaser, and libGDX.
        I've also made simple apps with Android Studio.
        I also have experience with back-end web development, thanks to Food Now!, a recent web application project.
        You can check out my game projects by clicking <a class="small-link" href="#game-projects">here</a>.

             The intention of the project is for me to learn in-depth about and play with various methods and functions libGDX has to offer through a simple game. I also wanted to make a simple game feel amazing to play, taking inspriration from grapefrukt games' <a class="small-link" href="http://grapefrukt.com/f/games/juicy-breakout/" target="_blank">juicy-breakout</a>.
             For the player, I want to make a game that looks aethetically pleasing, satisfying to play, and easy to pick up and play whenever they have some time to kill.
             As a developer, I want to make a light-weight game with robust, easy-to-read code, as well as use the project to exercise good game development practices.
             MinShmup currently doesn't have a public repository on GitHub, but will in the upcoming weeks.

            This game was three-week project for a senior game design studio class, just like Shroommates.

            A safety app prototype for Android.
            Users pick a contact and set a timer to get home.
            If the timer runs out, the phone will vibrate and prompt the user if they need more time.
            If the user does not respond within a specific timeframe, the phone will send a text to the contact and ring.
            After further lack of response, the app will call the contact.
            The idea of the app came from a statistic that the majority of women feel it is unsafe for them to walk outside at night by themselves.

          Hello!
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a Computer Science: Computer Game Design student at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
          I've taken various game design and courses, ranging from programming game AI, to programming procedural content generation, to making games with a studio of talented interdisciplinary students.
          I'm proficient at object-oriented programming in Java, using JavaScript for web development, and writing C# for Unity.
          I also like to think I have a decent eye for design as well.
          I've dabbled in a decent amount of C++, Lua, and Python as well, and I'm quick to pick up languages.
          I'm currently creeping into the proficient/experienced phase for game engines such Unreal Engine and Unity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm aiming to land a job as a game engineer or developer at any studio, but any software engineering job would be great as well.
          I have experience instructing a class on game design and development for Android to high school students at <a class="small-link" href="https://www.missionbit.com/" target="_blank">Mission Bit</a>, which is a great org with lots of fun people and classes.
          Although I will destroy almost anyone who challenges me in <i>Smash</i> there.
          I led my team for my Food Now! project, and am currently the lead developer of Shroommates - my senior game design studio game - so I have plenty of experience in teams, leadership, and communication.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Some online multiplayer games I'm hooked on are <a class="small-link" href="https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/home/index.aspx" target="_blank">Rainbow Six Siege</a> and
          <a class="small-link" href="https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Overwatch</a>.
          I also highly enjoy singleplayer games, most notably
          <a class="small-link" href="https://xcom.com/xcom-enemy-unknown" target="_blank">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</a> and
          <a class="small-link" href="https://xcom.com" target="_blank">XCOM 2</a>,
          <a class="small-link" href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/bastion/" target="_blank">Bastion</a>,
